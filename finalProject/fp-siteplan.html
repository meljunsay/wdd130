                </h4>
                <p>This company was established on February 27, 2022. It was born out of our personal necessity when it comes to home improvement or repairs. We noticed how difficult it is for us to find contractors here in Davao City, Philippines, who can
                    service our carpentry, plumbing and other home repair needs. There were existing social media groups of these service providers but it's hard to trust when there is no one vouching for their expertise and realibility in delivering
                    results.
                    <br> We created this company to connect clients with local expert/pros in different home repairs, improvements and other home service needs. To help clients get quality service we register only those contractors which we have carefully
                    screened and proven highly capable of quality workmanship, so you may rest assured that your money will not go to waste.
                    <br> We hope that we may be able to help you find the experts/pros you need for your home repair and improvement needs and get the best value service out of your budget.
                    <br> God bless!
                </p>
