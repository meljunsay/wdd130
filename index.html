    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm a <strong>stay-at-home-mom</strong> of 4 primary-aged children. We have 2 boys named, David, 10 years old and Jed, 7 years old. Our girls are Sophia, 8 years old and Lia, our youngest, is 1 year old.</p>
    <p>I have been married for 11 years to Jesse, who is a programmer. He was a 2nd counselor in our previous ward while I was a primary teacher. We just moved to a new ward so we are still waiting to receive our new callings.</p>
    <p>When I'm not <em>mothering</em> I'm busy learning new things like new baking recipes, or learning a new language, and right now I'm doing BYUI courses.</p>
    <p></p>
